This tutorial walked you through setting up a new project with Behave library and using test-driven development to build the code based off of behavioral tests.

If you would like to get experience writing more tests with this project, try implementing a `Player` class and `player.feature` that plays with some [basic strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy).

To learn more about BDD and why you might want to adopt it, check out our article on [Behaviour-Driven Development](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/behavior-driven-development)
